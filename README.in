## smfj

The `smfj` package provides a minimalist format for storing mesh data.

## Features

* Strongly-typed generic non-interleaved storage format.
* Carefully designed binary format that allows for mapping sections of files
  into memory for direct upload to the GPU. All data is strictly aligned for
  performance.
* Rich integer types: Store named arrays of 1-4 component 8/16/32/64-bit signed
  and unsigned integer vectors.
* Rich floating point types: Store named arrays of 1-4 component 16/32/64-bit
  floating-point vectors.
* Text and binary encodings.
* [Blender](http://blender.org) plugin to export directly to the text format.
* Event-based parsers for near zero-allocation parsing.
* Extensible filter system for processing and transforming mesh data.
* High coverage test suite.
* [OSGi-ready](https://www.osgi.org/)
* [JPMS-ready](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System)
* ISC license.
