[part [title Notational Conventions] [id conventions]]

[section [title Overview] [id conventions.overview]]
[paragraph]
This section of the specification documents all notational conventions used
throughout.

[section [title Unicode] [id conventions.unicode]]
[paragraph]
The specification makes reference to the Unicode character set which, at the
time of writing, is at version [term [type constant] 9.0]. The specification
often references specific Unicode characters, and does so using the standard
notation [term [type constant] U+NNNN], where [term [type variable] N]
represents a hexadecimal digit. For example, [term [type constant]  U+03BB]
corresponds to the lowercase lambda symbol [term [type constant] Î»].

[section [title EBNF] [id conventions.ebnf]]
[paragraph]
The specification gives grammar definitions in
[term [type package] ISO/IEC 14977:1996] Extended Backus-Naur form.

[section [title Haskell] [id conventions.haskell]]
[paragraph]
Rather than rely on untyped and ambiguous mathematical notation, this
documentation expresses all mathematics and type definitions in strict
[link-ext [target "http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/haskell2010/"] Haskell 2010]
with no extensions. All Haskell sources are included along with the
documentation and can therefore be executed from the command line
[link-ext [target "http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC/GHCi"] GHCi] tool
in order to interactively check results and experiment with functions.

[paragraph]
When used within prose, functions are referred to using fully qualified notation,
such as [term [type expression] "(Vector3f.cross n t)"]. This is the application
of the [term [type function] cross] function defined in the
[term [type package] Vector3f] module, to the arguments [term [type variable] n]
and [term [type variable] t].

[section [title FIX SBE] [id conventions.fix_sbe]]
[paragraph]
Definitions of binary structures are given as
[link-ext [target "http://fixprotocol.io/2016/sbe/"] FIX SBE] definitions.
All values are considered to be in big-endian byte order unless otherwise
specified.

[section [title Requirement Levels] [id conventions.reqs]]
[paragraph]
This specification uses terms such as MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, etc,
according to the definitions given in
[link-ext [target "http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt"] RFC 2119].
